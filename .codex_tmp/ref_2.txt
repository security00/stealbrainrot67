Below, we have given a few tips for each of the methods that will help you find a secret in the game: 1. Purchase a Secret from the Conveyor Since the drop rate of secret brainrots is the lowest, I would highly recommend joining a private server before you go ahead with this method. Steal a Brainrot private servers cost 79 Robux. So, if you don&#8217;t want any sort of chaos or unnecessary fights over the secret character on a public server, make sure to go ahead with the purchase.

This will improve the chances of spawning a secret in the game.

So, it might take some time before you get your first secret character. Finally, remember to save up a lot of cash because secrets in Steal a Brainrot cost hundreds of millions , and you won&#8217;t want to be short on it while they spawn. Especially, be prepared during the Steal a Brainrot admin events . 2. Steal a Secret Brainrot from Other Players The second way to get secrets is simply by stealing them from other players on a server. This will require you to join a public server where you will find other wealthy players who have a decent collection of some of the rarest brainrots in Steal a Brainrot . The best way to do this is to join a server, scan the area for secrets, and simply exit if there are none, and repeat the process. Naturally, it will take a while before you actually find players having secrets with them, but when you do so, remember that it&#8217;s just the beginning. Once you find a server with players having a secret brainrot, you must prepare yourself to steal the character. Here are some tips you should keep in mind: Keep a track of the player&#8217;s movements, whether they are simply farming cash and not making any move to get new characters. If you find them moving away from their base frequently, that&#8217;s your chance, and you must stay prepared for the base to unlock. Furthermore, you can try buying gears from the shop, such as traps, iron slaps, spring coils, bee launcher, and many more. Use the gears at the right moment to knock out the player or stun them for a few seconds. Do this just before the timer runs out for the gates to open, and make your run to get the secret Brainrot. Return to your base, lock it up, and for more assurance, you can now leave that server and join another one where no other players are experienced enough to steal from you. 3. Use the Craft Machine Next up is using the Craft machine present beside the Coins shop in the lobby. To use it, simply walk near the machine and press the &#8216; E &#8216; key to interact with it. The machine refreshes its items every 30 minutes. So, have a look at the units you can make at the moment on the left-hand side.

Once selected, all the Brainrot God units required to craft that secret will be displayed on the right-hand side. Submit them to the craft machine to start the process. It will take around 1.5 hours. And once the timer goes off, you can collect your secret. 4. Purchase from the Robux Shop Finally, the last way to get a secret in Steal a Brainrot is by spending some real-world money. Head to the Robux Shop in the lobby, and press the &#8216; E &#8216; key to open the menu. Scroll down, and you&#8217;ll find the three Lucky blocks. Image Credit: Steal a Brainrot/Roblox The Secret Lucky block costs 2399 Robux; however, purchasing it won&#8217;t guarantee you one of the best secrets in the game. Rather, it&#8217;s a random generator, where the lowest income ones have a high chance of spawning from the lucky block. So, these are some ways to get the secrets in Steal a Brainrot.
